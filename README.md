# Txt2Space

Load, explore and run basic operation on continuous (semantic) spaces from .txt format

Some supported functions and test: 
- cosine similarity
- knn extraction
- [Mitchell & Lapata](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1551-6709.2010.01106.x) 2010 test 
- space visualization (through [t-sne](https://lvdmaaten.github.io/tsne/))

## Basic instructions 

### File Format
Leave first line blank/for space information, as it will be discarded.
Vectors have to be stored in the word - vector format, e.g.

```bash
word -0.07512683  0.0956306   0.12752604 -0.21758722  0.04896387 -0.3884378 ...
```

Be sure there is no space between line start and word nor commas between numbers.

### Basic Usage
```python
txt_space = 'path/to/space.txt'
space = Space()
space.txt2space(amod, token=10000, dimensions=100, en_remove=True)
```
Alternatively, if the first line of the file contains space dimension (#tokens, #dimensions)

```python
space = Space()
space.txt2space(txt_space, dim_in_file=True)
space.extract_knn('man')
```

### Requirments
 - numpy >= 1.15.4
 - nltk >= 3.3
 - sklearn >= 0.20.0
