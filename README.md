# Txt2Space

This library allows you to load (static) vector spaces, saved in .txt format, and run multiple qualitative and quantitative investigaitons. 
Tests includes word similairty/relatednes benchmarks, as well visualisations analysis of the spaces. 

Some supported functions and test: 
- cosine similarity
- knn extraction
- space visualization (through PCA or [t-sne](https://lvdmaaten.github.io/tsne/))

word-word tasks:
- [SimLex-999](https://fh295.github.io/simlex.html)
- [MEN](https://staff.fnwi.uva.nl/e.bruni/MEN)
- [WordSim353](http://alfonseca.org/eng/research/wordsim353.html)

Composition based tasks
- [Relpron](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/J16-4004.pdf)
- [Mitchell & Lapata](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1551-6709.2010.01106.x) 2010 test

## Basic instructions 

### File Format
Vectors have to be stored in the word - vector format, e.g.

```bash
en_word -0.07512683  0.0956306   0.12752604 -0.21758722  0.04896387 -0.3884378 ...
```

Be sure there is no space between line start and word nor commas between numbers.

### Usage
```python
from txt2space import Space

txt_space = 'path/to/space.txt'
space = Space()
space.txt2space(txt_space, en_remove=True)
```
The en_remove argument, if True, will remove the prefix from words label during uploading. 

If the first line of the file contains space's informations (i.e. #tokens, #features), passsing the dim_in_file arguments as True will automatically update the information for upload. 

```python
space = Space()
space.txt2space(txt_space, dim_in_file=True)
space.run_tests(relpron_ds='dev', mix_gr_rel=True)
```
Tasks can be run invidually, or collectively, as shown below. For each mode, the retunr_results argumet will allow to store correlation variables (i.e correlation value, p value). Coverage indicates how many items from the origianl datasets have been tested. If even a single word from an item is missing, the all item will be ignored for the evaluaiton.
